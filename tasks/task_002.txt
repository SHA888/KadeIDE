# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement File System Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop core file system operations to enable reading, writing, and navigating files and directories.
# Details:
1. Implement file read/write operations in Rust backend
2. Create directory listing and navigation functionality
3. Develop file watcher for change detection
4. Implement file browser UI component using Preact or vanilla JS
5. Add file operations (new, delete, rename)
6. Create recent files tracking
7. Implement basic project/workspace concept

Example implementation:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn read_file(path: String) -> Result<String, String> {
  match fs::read_to_string(path) {
    Ok(content) => Ok(content),
    Err(e) => Err(e.to_string())
  }
}

#[tauri::command]
async fn write_file(path: String, content: String) -> Result<(), String> {
  match fs::write(path, content) {
    Ok(_) => Ok(()),
    Err(e) => Err(e.to_string())
  }
}

#[tauri::command]
async fn list_directory(path: String) -> Result<Vec<FileInfo>, String> {
  // Implementation to list directory contents
}
```

```javascript
// fileBrowser.js
function FileBrowser({ currentPath, files }) {
  // Render file browser component
  // Handle file selection, navigation
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each file system operation function
2. Test file operations with various file types and sizes
3. Verify file watching functionality detects changes correctly
4. Test directory navigation with deep folder structures
5. Validate error handling for invalid paths, permissions issues
6. Performance test with large directories
7. Test file browser UI rendering and interaction

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Backend File Read/Write Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Rust functions to handle basic file read and write operations with proper error handling
### Details:
Develop core file I/O functions in Rust that handle reading from and writing to files. Implement proper error handling, support for various file encodings, and ensure operations are non-blocking where appropriate. Include functionality for handling large files efficiently.

## 2. Implement Directory Listing Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create backend functions to list directory contents with filtering and sorting options
### Details:
Develop Rust functions to traverse and list directory contents, including support for filtering by file type, sorting options, and handling of hidden files. Ensure performance optimization for large directories and implement proper error handling for permission issues.

## 3. Implement File Watcher System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create a file system watcher that detects changes and notifies the application
### Details:
Implement a file watcher system in Rust that monitors directories and files for changes (creation, deletion, modification). Design an event system to notify the application of these changes in real-time. Ensure cross-platform compatibility and optimize for minimal resource usage.

## 4. Design and Implement File Browser UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create a responsive UI component for browsing files and directories
### Details:
Design and implement a file browser UI component that displays directory contents, supports navigation, and provides visual cues for different file types. Include features like column sorting, list/grid views, and ensure accessibility compliance. Optimize rendering for directories with many files.

## 5. Implement File Operations UI and Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.4
### Description: Create functionality for file creation, deletion, and renaming operations
### Details:
Implement both UI components and backend functions for common file operations including creating new files/directories, deleting items, and renaming. Include confirmation dialogs for destructive operations and ensure proper error handling and user feedback.

## 6. Develop Recent Files Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.4
### Description: Implement a system to track and display recently accessed files
### Details:
Create a system that tracks recently accessed files, persists this information between sessions, and provides a UI for quickly accessing these files. Include functionality to clear history and limit the number of tracked files. Ensure proper handling of deleted or moved files.

## 7. Implement Project/Workspace Concept [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Design and implement project/workspace functionality for managing related files
### Details:
Create a project/workspace system that allows users to group related files and directories. Implement functionality to save, load, and switch between workspaces. Include features like project-specific settings, project-wide search, and workspace metadata management.

## 8. Optimize Error Handling and Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and performance optimizations across all file operations
### Details:
Review and enhance error handling across all file operations, ensuring user-friendly error messages and recovery options. Conduct performance analysis and optimization for file operations, particularly for large files and directories. Implement caching strategies and background processing where appropriate.
