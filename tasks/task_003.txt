# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate Monaco Editor Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate a stripped-down version of Monaco Editor with essential features for code editing.
# Details:
1. Import minimal Monaco Editor package
2. Configure Monaco for essential features only
3. Implement editor state management
4. Add basic syntax highlighting for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python
5. Implement editor pane UI component
6. Create save/load integration with file system
7. Optimize Monaco bundle size with tree shaking

Implementation approach:
```javascript
// editor.js
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.api';

// Only import essential languages
import 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/basic-languages/typescript/typescript.contribution';
import 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/basic-languages/javascript/javascript.contribution';
import 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/basic-languages/python/python.contribution';

function createEditor(container, initialContent = '') {
  const editor = monaco.editor.create(container, {
    value: initialContent,
    language: 'javascript',
    theme: 'vs-dark',
    minimap: { enabled: false },
    automaticLayout: true,
    fontSize: 14,
    lineNumbers: 'on',
    scrollBeyondLastLine: false,
    // Minimal set of features
  });
  
  return editor;
}
```

Editor state model:
```javascript
const editorState = {
  activeFile: null,
  openFiles: [],
  cursorPosition: { line: 0, column: 0 },
  selections: [],
  undoStack: []
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure Monaco Editor bundle size after optimization
2. Test syntax highlighting for supported languages
3. Verify editor performance with large files
4. Test save/load functionality with the file system
5. Validate editor state management
6. Test undo/redo functionality
7. Verify editor renders correctly across different screen sizes
8. Benchmark memory usage during editing operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement minimal Monaco Editor import [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the minimal required imports from Monaco Editor to reduce bundle size while maintaining core functionality.
### Details:
Research Monaco Editor's modular structure, identify essential modules needed for basic editing functionality, configure webpack/rollup/vite to import only necessary components, and verify the editor loads with minimal dependencies.

## 2. Configure core editor features [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up essential Monaco Editor features like line numbers, minimap, and basic editing capabilities.
### Details:
Initialize editor with appropriate configuration options, enable/disable features based on performance considerations, implement basic keyboard shortcuts, and ensure editor instance is properly mounted in the application.

## 3. Implement editor state management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create a state management solution to handle editor content, cursor position, and selection state.
### Details:
Design state structure for editor content, implement change handlers to update application state, manage undo/redo history, and ensure state persistence across component re-renders.

## 4. Set up syntax highlighting and language support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Configure Monaco Editor for proper syntax highlighting and language-specific features.
### Details:
Register required languages, load language definitions dynamically to reduce initial bundle size, configure tokenization rules, and implement language detection based on file extensions.

## 5. Design and implement editor pane UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create the UI components surrounding the Monaco Editor instance for a complete editing experience.
### Details:
Design layout for editor container, implement tabs for multiple files, create status bar with editor information, add UI controls for common actions, and ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.

## 6. Integrate with file system [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.5
### Description: Connect Monaco Editor with file system operations for loading and saving files.
### Details:
Implement file loading mechanism, create save/save-as functionality, handle unsaved changes detection, implement auto-save feature, and manage file metadata.

## 7. Optimize bundle size and performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.4, 3.6
### Description: Implement advanced optimizations to reduce Monaco Editor's impact on application size and performance.
### Details:
Set up code splitting for Monaco components, implement lazy loading for language features, measure and optimize editor initialization time, reduce memory usage through proper disposal of editor instances, and implement worker offloading for intensive operations.
