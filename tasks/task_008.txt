Ollama provider implementation:
```rust
struct OllamaProvider {
  endpoint: String,
  model: String,
  client: reqwest::Client,
  cache: Arc<Mutex<AiResponseCache>>,
}

impl OllamaProvider {
  pub fn new(endpoint: String, model: String, cache: Arc<Mutex<AiResponseCache>>) -> Self {
    // Initialize Ollama provider
  }
  
  pub async fn list_models(&self) -> Result<Vec<OllamaModel>, AiError> {
    // List available models from Ollama
  }
  
  pub async fn pull_model(&self, model_name: &str) -> Result<impl Stream<Item = Result<PullProgress, AiError>>, AiError> {
    // Pull model from Ollama
  }
}

impl AiProvider for OllamaProvider {
  fn name(&self) -> &str {
    "ollama"
  }
  
  fn capabilities(&self) -> AiCapabilities {
    AiCapabilities {
      supports_streaming: true,
      supports_code_completion: true,
      supports_chat: true,
      context_window: 4096, // Depends on model
    }
  }
  
  async fn complete_code(&self, prompt: &str, context: &CodeContext) -> Result<String, AiError> {
    // Implement code completion using Ollama API
  }
  
  async fn chat(&self, messages: &[ChatMessage]) -> Result<ChatResponse, AiError> {
    // Implement chat using Ollama API
  }
  
  async fn stream_chat(&self, messages: &[ChatMessage]) -> Result<impl Stream<Item = Result<ChatResponseChunk, AiError>>, AiError> {
    // Implement streaming chat using Ollama API
  }
}
```

Model manager UI:
```javascript
function ModelManager({ models, activeModel, onModelSelect, onModelPull }) {
  const [pulling, setPulling] = useState(false);
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  
  async function pullModel(modelName) {
    setPulling(true);
    setProgress(0);
    try {
      await onModelPull(modelName, (p) => setProgress(p));
    } finally {
      setPulling(false);
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="model-manager">
      {/* Model manager UI */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Ollama client library integration
2. Verify model download and management
3. Test CodeLLaMA model support
4. Validate TinyLLaMA with quantization
5. Test model switching interface
6. Verify progress indicators for model operations
7. Benchmark memory usage with different models
8. Test error handling for Ollama connection issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Ollama client integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a client interface to communicate with Ollama for local model management
### Details:
Develop a client module that can connect to the Ollama API, handle authentication, send requests, and process responses. Include error handling for connection issues and implement retry logic for failed requests.

## 2. Create model download management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement functionality to download, track, and manage local AI models
### Details:
Build a system to handle model downloads, including download queuing, progress tracking, verification of downloaded files, and handling interrupted downloads. Create a database schema to store model metadata and download status.

## 3. Add support for CodeLLaMA and TinyLLaMA models [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Ensure compatibility with CodeLLaMA and TinyLLaMA model architectures
### Details:
Implement model-specific adapters for CodeLLaMA and TinyLLaMA. Configure input/output processing to match these models' requirements. Test inference with various prompts to ensure proper functionality.

## 4. Implement model quantization capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Add support for quantizing models to reduce memory footprint
### Details:
Integrate quantization algorithms (4-bit, 8-bit) for model compression. Create options for users to select quantization level based on their hardware capabilities. Implement benchmarking to show performance differences between quantization levels.

## 5. Develop model switching UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create user interface for selecting and switching between different local models
### Details:
Design and implement a UI component that displays available models, their sizes, and capabilities. Include functionality to switch between models with minimal latency. Add model comparison features to help users select appropriate models.

## 6. Implement progress indicators for model operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.5
### Description: Add visual feedback for download, loading, and inference processes
### Details:
Create progress bars and status indicators for model downloads, initialization, and inference. Implement estimated time remaining calculations. Ensure indicators are responsive and accurately reflect the current state of operations.

## 7. Optimize memory usage for local model execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement memory management strategies for efficient model execution
### Details:
Develop memory optimization techniques such as gradient checkpointing, attention caching, and model unloading when idle. Implement automatic memory usage monitoring and adaptive strategies based on available system resources. Create configuration options for users with different hardware capabilities.
