# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Tauri Application Shell
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundation for KadeIDE by setting up a Tauri application shell with webview integration and basic project structure.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Tauri project with Rust backend
2. Configure the project for minimal binary size
3. Setup the webview component with basic HTML/CSS structure
4. Implement basic IPC communication between frontend and backend
5. Create the application shell with minimal UI
6. Configure build pipeline with esbuild
7. Implement basic window management

Code structure:
```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
      read_file,
      write_file,
      list_directory
    ])
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("Error while running tauri application");
}
```

```javascript
// main.js
const { invoke } = window.__TAURI__.tauri;

async function readFile(path) {
  return await invoke('read_file', { path });
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Tauri application builds successfully
2. Test basic IPC communication between frontend and backend
3. Measure initial binary size to ensure it's on track for target metrics
4. Verify application launches on all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
5. Test window management functionality
6. Validate webview rendering performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Tauri Project [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Tauri project using the CLI tool and select appropriate templates
### Details:
Install Tauri CLI, run initialization command, select minimal template options, verify project structure, and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. Configure package.json and Cargo.toml with appropriate metadata.

## 2. Configure for Minimal Binary Size [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Optimize Tauri configuration to minimize the final binary size
### Details:
Edit tauri.conf.json to disable unnecessary features, configure bundle settings for optimal compression, set up tree-shaking for frontend code, and implement resource optimization strategies. Test configuration changes with build size analysis.

## 3. Set Up Webview Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure the webview component and its integration with the Tauri backend
### Details:
Configure webview settings in tauri.conf.json, set up content security policies, implement proper URL handling, configure dev server integration, and test webview rendering with basic content.

## 4. Implement IPC Communication [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Set up inter-process communication between the frontend and Rust backend
### Details:
Create basic Rust commands that can be invoked from JavaScript, implement event listeners, set up proper error handling for IPC calls, and create a simple test to verify bidirectional communication works correctly.

## 5. Create Minimal UI Shell [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop a basic UI framework that will serve as the application shell
### Details:
Set up HTML/CSS/JS structure for the application shell, implement responsive layout basics, create placeholder components for main application areas, and ensure proper styling for window controls.

## 6. Configure Build Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up the development and production build pipeline for the application
### Details:
Configure frontend build tools (webpack/vite/etc.), set up environment-specific configurations, implement build scripts in package.json, configure Rust compilation options, and test the complete build process for development and production.

## 7. Implement Window Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Set up window creation, management, and customization features
### Details:
Configure window properties in tauri.conf.json, implement window creation/closing logic, add support for multiple windows if needed, implement custom window controls, and ensure proper window state persistence.
