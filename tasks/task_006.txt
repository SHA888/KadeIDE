# Task ID: 6
# Title: Design and Implement AI Provider Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a modular AI provider system that supports multiple backends including cloud APIs and local models.
# Details:
1. Design unified AI provider interface
2. Implement provider abstraction layer
3. Create request/response models for AI interactions
4. Develop provider factory for dynamic loading
5. Implement caching layer for AI responses
6. Add streaming response support
7. Create provider configuration management

AI provider interface:
```rust
trait AiProvider {
  fn name(&self) -> &str;
  fn capabilities(&self) -> AiCapabilities;
  async fn complete_code(&self, prompt: &str, context: &CodeContext) -> Result<String, AiError>;
  async fn chat(&self, messages: &[ChatMessage]) -> Result<ChatResponse, AiError>;
  async fn stream_chat(&self, messages: &[ChatMessage]) -> Result<impl Stream<Item = Result<ChatResponseChunk, AiError>>, AiError>;
}

struct AiCapabilities {
  supports_streaming: bool,
  supports_code_completion: bool,
  supports_chat: bool,
  context_window: usize,
}

struct AiProviderFactory {
  providers: HashMap<String, Box<dyn AiProvider>>,
  settings: Arc<RwLock<Settings>>,
}

impl AiProviderFactory {
  pub fn new(settings: Arc<RwLock<Settings>>) -> Self {
    // Initialize provider factory
  }
  
  pub fn get_provider(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&Box<dyn AiProvider>> {
    self.providers.get(name)
  }
  
  pub fn active_provider(&self) -> Option<&Box<dyn AiProvider>> {
    // Get currently active provider from settings
  }
  
  pub fn register_provider(&mut self, provider: Box<dyn AiProvider>) {
    // Register new provider
  }
}
```

Cache implementation:
```rust
struct AiResponseCache {
  cache: HashMap<String, (Instant, String)>,
  max_size: usize,
  ttl: Duration,
}

impl AiResponseCache {
  pub fn new(max_size: usize, ttl: Duration) -> Self {
    // Initialize cache
  }
  
  pub fn get(&mut self, key: &str) -> Option<String> {
    // Get cached response if not expired
  }
  
  pub fn put(&mut self, key: String, value: String) {
    // Cache response and manage cache size
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test AI provider interface implementation
2. Test provider factory with mock providers
3. Verify provider switching mechanism
4. Test caching layer functionality
5. Validate streaming response handling
6. Test provider configuration management
7. Benchmark response times with and without caching
8. Verify error handling for provider failures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core AI provider interface that all concrete implementations will implement
### Details:
Create a base interface with essential methods like 'generate', 'embed', etc. Include documentation for each method. Define error handling patterns and common return types. Consider versioning strategy for the interface.

## 2. Implement Abstraction Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create an abstraction layer to decouple client code from specific provider implementations
### Details:
Design adapter patterns to normalize differences between providers. Implement strategy pattern for provider selection. Create middleware hooks for cross-cutting concerns like logging and telemetry.

## 3. Define Request/Response Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create standardized data models for requests and responses across different providers
### Details:
Design immutable data classes for requests with builder patterns. Create response models with proper error handling. Include serialization/deserialization support. Ensure models are extensible for future provider-specific features.

## 4. Implement Provider Factory [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create a factory system to instantiate and manage different AI provider implementations
### Details:
Design factory methods for creating provider instances. Implement provider discovery mechanism. Add support for dependency injection. Include provider lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown).

## 5. Develop Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement a caching layer to optimize repeated requests to AI providers
### Details:
Design cache key generation strategy based on request parameters. Implement TTL and size-based eviction policies. Add cache statistics and monitoring. Support distributed caching for horizontal scaling.

## 6. Add Streaming Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement streaming capabilities for providers that support incremental responses
### Details:
Design reactive streaming interfaces (Observable pattern). Implement backpressure handling. Add timeout and cancellation support. Create adapters for non-streaming providers to maintain consistent interface.

## 7. Create Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Develop a system to manage provider configurations and credentials
### Details:
Implement secure credential storage. Create configuration validation. Support environment-specific configurations. Add dynamic reconfiguration without restart. Include audit logging for configuration changes.

## 8. Build Provider Registration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4, 6.7
### Description: Create a registry system for dynamically adding and managing provider implementations
### Details:
Implement provider registration API. Add provider capability discovery. Create provider health checking and circuit breaking. Support hot-swapping providers. Include metrics collection for provider performance.
