# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement LSP Client and Server Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Language Server Protocol (LSP) client in the Rust backend and integrate with language servers for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.
# Details:
1. Implement LSP client in Rust backend
2. Create external process management for language servers
3. Implement stdio communication with LSP servers
4. Add TypeScript language server integration
5. Add JavaScript language server integration
6. Add Python language server integration
7. Create diagnostics display UI
8. Implement hover information and go-to-definition
9. Add code completion with IntelliSense

LSP client implementation:
```rust
struct LspClient {
  process: Child,
  reader: BufReader<ChildStdout>,
  writer: BufWriter<ChildStdin>,
  request_counter: AtomicU64,
}

impl LspClient {
  pub fn new(command: &str, args: &[&str]) -> Result<Self, Error> {
    // Start language server process and setup communication
  }
  
  pub async fn initialize(&mut self, root_uri: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Send initialize request to LSP server
  }
  
  pub async fn completion(&mut self, uri: &str, position: Position) -> Result<CompletionResponse, Error> {
    // Request completions from LSP server
  }
  
  // Other LSP methods: hover, definition, diagnostics, etc.
}
```

LSP manager implementation:
```rust
struct LspManager {
  clients: HashMap<String, LspClient>,
  settings: Arc<RwLock<Settings>>,
}

impl LspManager {
  pub fn new(settings: Arc<RwLock<Settings>>) -> Self {
    // Initialize LSP manager
  }
  
  pub async fn get_client_for_language(&mut self, language: &str) -> Result<&mut LspClient, Error> {
    // Get or create LSP client for language
  }
  
  pub async fn handle_request(&mut self, request: LspRequest) -> Result<serde_json::Value, Error> {
    // Route LSP requests to appropriate client
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test LSP client initialization and communication
2. Verify language server process management
3. Test LSP request/response handling
4. Validate TypeScript/JavaScript language server integration
5. Test Python language server integration
6. Verify diagnostics display in UI
7. Test code completion functionality
8. Validate hover information and go-to-definition
9. Performance test LSP response times
10. Test error handling for LSP server failures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Rust LSP client core [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core Rust LSP client implementation that handles the base protocol and message structure
### Details:
Implement the core LSP client in Rust that can serialize/deserialize LSP protocol messages, handle JSON-RPC, and maintain the client state. Include basic connection management and message routing infrastructure.

## 2. Develop process management for language servers [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a robust process management system to spawn, monitor, and terminate language server processes
### Details:
Implement process spawning, lifecycle management, health monitoring, and graceful termination. Handle process crashes and implement automatic restart capabilities. Support configuration for different server launch parameters.

## 3. Implement stdio communication layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Build the stdin/stdout communication layer for exchanging messages with language servers
### Details:
Create an asynchronous I/O system for reading from and writing to language server processes. Implement proper message framing according to the LSP specification, handle partial reads/writes, and ensure thread safety.

## 4. Add TypeScript/JavaScript server integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Integrate with TypeScript/JavaScript language servers (tsserver)
### Details:
Implement specific configuration and initialization for TypeScript/JavaScript language servers. Handle language-specific features and quirks. Test with various TypeScript/JavaScript projects to ensure compatibility.

## 5. Add Python server integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Integrate with Python language servers (pyright/pylsp)
### Details:
Implement specific configuration and initialization for Python language servers. Handle Python-specific features and virtual environment detection. Test with various Python projects to ensure compatibility.

## 6. Implement diagnostics UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Create UI components to display diagnostics (errors, warnings, hints) from language servers
### Details:
Implement UI for displaying diagnostics in the editor. Include features like error underlining, gutter indicators, problem panel integration, and filtering options. Ensure proper updating when diagnostics change.

## 7. Implement hover and go-to-definition features [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.6
### Description: Add support for hover information display and go-to-definition navigation
### Details:
Implement hover UI to display type information and documentation. Create go-to-definition functionality that navigates to symbol definitions. Handle cross-file navigation and support for external definitions.

## 8. Implement code completion [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.6
### Description: Add intelligent code completion using LSP suggestions
### Details:
Create a completion provider that requests and displays suggestions from language servers. Implement filtering, sorting, and rendering of completion items. Support for different types of completions (methods, variables, snippets) and context-aware filtering.

## 9. Develop comprehensive error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement robust error handling throughout the LSP integration
### Details:
Add error handling for network issues, malformed messages, server crashes, and timeouts. Implement retry mechanisms, fallback strategies, and user notifications. Create detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## 10. Conduct performance testing and optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9
### Description: Test and optimize performance of the LSP integration
