      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Tauri Application Shell",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the Tauri application shell into subtasks covering project initialization, configuration for minimal binary size, webview integration, IPC setup, minimal UI creation, build pipeline configuration, and window management.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a Tauri application shell involves multiple cross-cutting concerns: initializing a Rust backend, configuring for minimal binary size, integrating the webview, establishing IPC, and managing the build pipeline. Each step is distinct and requires attention to platform-specific details and tooling, but leverages Tauri's built-in templates and tools, keeping complexity moderate[1][2][4]."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement File System Operations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the file system operations task into subtasks for backend file read/write, directory listing, file watcher implementation, file browser UI, file operations (new, delete, rename), recent files tracking, project/workspace concept, and error/performance handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans both backend (Rust) and frontend (UI) development, requiring robust error handling, performance considerations, and cross-platform compatibility. Implementing file watchers and a responsive file browser adds to the complexity, as does ensuring seamless IPC between layers."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Monaco Editor Core",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose Monaco Editor integration into subtasks for minimal package import, feature configuration, state management, syntax highlighting setup, editor pane UI, file system integration, and bundle optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating Monaco Editor requires careful bundle management, state synchronization, and UI integration. Optimizing for size and performance, while ensuring robust editing features and file system connectivity, makes this a moderately complex task."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Settings and Configuration System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the settings system into subtasks for schema design, backend read/write, default configuration, hot-reload mechanism, UI component (optional), validation logic, and workspace-specific overrides.",
      "reasoning": "While settings management is a common requirement, supporting hot-reload, validation, and workspace-specific overrides adds complexity. The need for a robust schema and seamless integration with both backend and frontend increases the number of logical subtasks."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement LSP Client and Server Integration",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand LSP integration into subtasks for Rust LSP client implementation, process management, stdio communication, TypeScript/JavaScript/Python server integration, diagnostics UI, hover/go-to-definition, code completion, error handling, and performance testing.",
      "reasoning": "LSP integration is highly complex, involving asynchronous process management, protocol handling, multi-language support, and deep UI integration for diagnostics and code intelligence. Robust error handling and performance tuning are critical, warranting a high complexity score."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the AI provider interface into subtasks for interface design, abstraction layer, request/response models, provider factory, caching, streaming support, configuration management, and provider registration.",
      "reasoning": "Designing a modular AI provider system with support for multiple backends, streaming, and caching requires advanced abstraction and extensibility. Ensuring seamless switching and configuration management adds to the architectural complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Cloud AI Provider Integrations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand cloud AI provider integrations into subtasks for each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, Grok), API key management, error/rate limiting, and provider-specific configuration.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating multiple cloud AI providers involves handling diverse APIs, authentication, rate limiting, and error management. Each provider may have unique requirements, increasing the number of subtasks and overall complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Local AI Model Integration via Ollama",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down local AI model integration into subtasks for Ollama client integration, model download management, CodeLLaMA/TinyLLaMA support, quantization, model switching UI, progress indicators, and memory optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Supporting local AI models requires managing downloads, quantization, memory usage, and UI for model management. Ensuring smooth integration with the AI provider interface and handling resource constraints adds to the complexity."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create AI-Powered UI Components",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand AI-powered UI components into subtasks for inline completion, chat sidebar, code explanation panel, provider switching UI, streaming rendering, suggestion highlighting, keyboard shortcuts, and user experience validation.",
      "reasoning": "Developing interactive AI-powered UI components requires real-time communication, streaming response handling, and seamless integration with the editor and backend. Ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience across features increases complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose performance and packaging into subtasks for lazy loading, resource monitoring, feature toggles, response caching, bundle optimization, UPX compression, profiling, packaging configuration, and cross-platform testing.",
      "reasoning": "Final performance optimization and packaging require a holistic approach, touching all layers of the application. Implementing lazy loading, resource monitoring, and advanced build optimizations, while ensuring cross-platform compatibility and meeting strict performance targets, makes this a highly complex task[3][4][5]."
